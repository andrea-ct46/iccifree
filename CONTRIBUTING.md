## üíª Coding Standards

### JavaScript

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good
const userStream = async (userId) => {
    try {
        const stream = await getStream(userId);
        return stream;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Stream error:', error);
        throw error;
    }
};

// ‚ùå Bad
function getUserStream(userId) {
    return getStream(userId);
}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Always handle errors with try/catch
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused

### CSS

```css
/* ‚úÖ Good */
.button-primary {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FFD700 0%, #FFA500 100%);
    padding: 12px 24px;
    border-radius: 8px;
}

/* ‚ùå Bad */
.btn1 {
    background: gold;
    padding: 12px 24px;
}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use kebab-case for class names
- Follow BEM methodology when appropriate
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Avoid !important unless absolutely necessary

### HTML

```html
<!-- ‚úÖ Good -->
<button class="primary-btn" aria-label="Start streaming">
    Go Live
</button>

<!-- ‚ùå Bad -->
<div onclick="goLive()">Go Live</div>
```

**Guidelines:**
- Semantic HTML elements
- Proper accessibility attributes
- Self-closing tags for void elements
- Consistent indentation (2 spaces)
